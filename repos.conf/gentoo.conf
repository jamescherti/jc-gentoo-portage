# Description:
# ------------
# Synchronizing with the Gentoo Portage ebuild repository using emerge --sync
# can be slow when utilizing the rsync protocol. However, an effective solution
# exists that can greatly improve the synchronization speed: Configuring emerge
# --sync to synchronize using Git instead.
